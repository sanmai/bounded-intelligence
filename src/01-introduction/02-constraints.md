# The Constraints

## Boundary

I'm only interested in living systems with a defined boundary: it created the first distinction, inside versus outside. Viruses and self-reproducing enzymes that predated early protocells are out of scope.

## Sufficiency

Our environment has infinite ways to kill us. In a world full of threats and competition, a simple life didn't stand a chance. Simplicity wasn't getting a pass.

On the other hand, life always had finite means to persist. Every invention, every bit of structure, every pathway took a toll on finite energy,  nutrients, and time. Complexity has an upper bound.

Life had to increase complexity only as much as required. Sufficiently so.

## Correspondence

Just like if there's an apple in your hand, there's an apple in your mind. If there's a physical distinction, then there's a conceptual distinction. If the distinction counts, it is in the language. I'm using the physical structure as a map to find the conceptual structure and discover meaning. Our language is the evidence that the map is accurate.

Let's see how these constraints [were in play 4 billion years ago](./03-membrane.md).

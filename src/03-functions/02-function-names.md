# Naming Functions

A bunch of cars are moving erratically, some standing still, and some barely moving. The stopping lights are lighting up and fading, as far as you can see. Clearly, it is a traffic jam. If you know the pattern, you know how to reason about it: every traffic jam has an average flow rate and total length, and if we know the properties of this emergent phenomenon, we can predict when we'll get home. Very useful!

The make, model, and exact position of every car on the road describe the recipe of a traffic jam, but do a poor job of explaining the outcome, just as the list of ingredients can't alone explain the chiffon cake. Just like this, Know to Sense or Feel to Predict are only recipes, not flavors that emerge from these simple parts.

But we can't just use any names for these flavors. If a name, an idea, falls strictly into one of the pre-existing four buckets, it is too primitive to capture the emergent flavor accurately. Rather, good names must follow a cause-and-effect structure, linking concepts from the earlier four buckets.

Ideally, we want the names to be memorable and distinct from each other, while avoiding confusion. Say, if an idea can be subjective or objective depending on the context, it won't work.

My actual process for coming up with these mnemonics was much less straightforward and messy. I started with some initial ideas, used them to uncover attributes, and then iterated to find better names. I'll list these bridge ideas where they make sense.
